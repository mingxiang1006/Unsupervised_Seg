# Unsupervised_Seg
This challenge involves unsupervised segmentation of thin section images. There are 1000 unlabeled images in the dataset your job will be to provide a model that can accurately segment the blobs on the thin sections.

Scale is one of the more interesting aspects of science.  Biology investigates genomes and entire ecosystems.  Physics spans quantum forces to gravitational waves from the Big Bang.  Understanding all the different scales for a problem helps us better understand our natural world and how it is changing.  For this challenge, we're asking you to investigate the micrometer scale of geosciences by examining thin sections of rocks and identifying their components.

This challenge aims to build a machine-learning solution to a problem often encountered by machine learning researchers; label scarcity. Challengers will recieve 1000 unlabeled thin section images, and will need to provide a model that is able to correctly segment all blobs on each image.
